**Manual**:

Advances in technology have resulted in large spatial datasets for aquatic and terrestrial populations that requires data compilation and analysis for making sound resource management and conservation decisions. From GIS and GPS dataset manipulation to traditional estimators of home range, this course will provide hands-on learning to handle a variety of datasets all within the free software R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). You will develop skills in understanding and processing complex datasets without ever needing ArcMap or related costly programs.
