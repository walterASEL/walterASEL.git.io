## About me

I am the Assistant Unit Leader at the Pennsylvania Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit (Unit) and serve as Adjunct Associate Professor of Wildlife Ecology in the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management (Department) at The Pennsylvania State University (PSU). I am responsible for conducting wildlife research, both basic and applied, in collaboration with Unit cooperators as well as for other clients of the U. S. Geological Survey. As an adjunct faculty member, I contribute to PSU by mentoring graduate students, teaching graduate-level courses, and serving on university committees. I am a member of the Intercollege Graduate Degree Program in Ecology where I serve on program committees, advise graduate students, and serve on graduate committees. As Adjunct Associate Professor, I teach a graduate level course in Applied Spatial Ecology using Program R. I also provide an Applied Spatial Ecology Workshop to cooperators annually that include personnel from the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission, Pennsylvania Game Commission, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service along with individuals from other universities and non-profit organizations that wish to attend. I have an active role in our department that includes being on Graduate Exam committees, deciding curriculum requirements for graduate students, and participating in departmental seminars, functions, and interactions typical of faculty in a university setting.

In addition to responsibilities as a Principal Investigator on various research studies (50% FTE),
I manage several research labs, which includes supervising a Laboratory Manager and Research
Technologist, hiring technicians, and managing budgets for projects that use the labs (15% FTE).
Along with supervisory responsibilities over my labs, I am responsible for advising graduate students (as sole advisor and co-advisor) and their academic programs and research projects for MS or PhD degrees. This work includes securing funding through competitive grant proposals to support
research, developing study designs, organizing field components, arranging program of study, and
data analysis/preparation of manuscripts from theses and dissertations (15% FTE). I am also responsible for maintaining numerous databases and archiving metadata for hundreds of thousands of
data that includes telemetry locations, genetic samples, and disease surveillance datasets collected in my laboratories or provided by collaborating agencies (20% FTE).
